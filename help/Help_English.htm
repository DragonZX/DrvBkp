The list at center of screen shows all devices found on local computer, sorted by ownership class.<br>
Usually all devices are listed, but you can select a specify provider class or setting "Full portability" or "Digital signature".</p>

<h1>Backup of Drivers</h1>
<p>To select a provider class click on one of buttons upon the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>All: Shows all devices</li>
<li>OEM: Shows devices with a Microsoft driver.</li>
<li>Third party: Shows devices with a third party driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Digital signature" button select devices with a digital signature ("WHQL") only.<br>
"Full portability" button select devices that are totally compatible with backup and restore.<br>
When you have selected desired devices, click on "Backup" button to open backup window.<br>
Click on "Browse" button and select a directory where backup's files will be copied. It's recommended to select an empty directory. At the end of process program generates a Backup Info File (.BKI), that contains information about backup and backuped devices.<br>
Every directory name,from backup main directory to single device one, can be formatted using special format specifiers.<br>
For a detailed description of format specifiers click here.<br>
"Allow DriverBackup! to ovewrite files" checkbox enable DriverBackup! to ovewrite files in backup path, if required. Otherwise program raises an error.<br>
"Generate file for auto-restoration" checkbox forces DriverBackup! to generate executable files for automatic drivers' restoration. These files include a batch file "Restore.bat" and "Autorun.inf" that enables autorun in removable devices (USB Flash,CD-DVD-ROM).</p>

<p>PS: In order to enable autorun, backup files (Backup Info file ".BKI" and directory tree) must be copied in root path of device.</p>

<p class="notice">Notice:</p>
<p class="noticeb">Some devices are marked as "incompatible" or "partially incompatibile". It means that DriverBackup! hasn't found some files or device's configuration suggests that it could be compatible with current system only.</p>


<h1>Restoration of Drivers</h1>
<p>In the main window, select restore mode with "Restore" button at top of screen.<br>
First step of restoration is selection of a .BKI file containing information about backuped drivers.<br>
When a package file is selected DriverBackup! Scans hardware connected to computer and checks all backup files.<br>
For default DriverBackup! selects only drivers that could be useful for hardware devices connected to computer but other drivers can be selected also.</p>

<p>There are two restoration modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install mode: A particular device connected to computer needs a driver, so driver is installed for first time.</li>
<li>Update mode: A particular device is correctly installed, but driver is older than backuped one. In this case DriverBackup! performs updating of files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select desired devices and press "Restore" button.<br>
Click on  "Restore" button and  DriverBackup! will restore selected devices.<br>
If "Scan for new Plug n Play devices.." checkbox is selected program forces system to update its hardware configuration after restoration process is completed. Probably some drivers require system reboot to work properly.<br>
Selecting "Update driver configuration."checkbox, program never ask to forcing driver's update. If update operation fails an error is reported in logging list.</p>

<p class="notice">Notice:</p>
<p class="noticeb">If a device has some files missing it is marked as "incompatible" and it can't be restored.</p>

<li>Click on "Backup from offline system" button.</li>
<li>Specify path of target system. (Example: Z:\Windows)</li>
</ol>
<p>If program detects a valid operating system , name of target computer should be displayed near "Offline computer name" label.<br>
In this case click to "Load" button to retrieve drivers information and "Ok" button to proceed.<br>
Device listing is same as normal backup mode.</p>
<p>Notice:</p>
<p>To run offline backup procedure ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES are required.<br>
